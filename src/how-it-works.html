        <p class="lead" style="font-weight: 550;">Standing in the queue and waiting for your turn to cast vote is a part of a history now. </p>

        <p>In every democratic country elections occur and it is taken either by using ballet paper or e-voting which is centralised. E-voting is in use for a long period of time because it has some benefits over Paper based systems but this conventional e-voting system is centralized. A particular central administration manages the entire system and has control over the database and due to this has the possibility of manipulating data. But by using blockchain technology the e-voting system which I have created is decentralised. Blockchain is a disruptive technology of this era which has potential to solve all the problems of the e-voting system. </p>

        <p>Blockchain based voting is the upcoming way of casting vote where all the votes will be stored in the Blockchain network, which provide security, voter authentication, accessibility and voter anonymity .</p>
